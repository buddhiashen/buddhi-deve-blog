In the first article, we talk and building a speech recognition system but it uses the internet to connect to google and use its speech recognition algorithm, today in this article we going to build a speech recognition system when you are offline.

let's get started.

First of all, there is a python library called, VOSK. to install it on your computer type this command

```shell
pip3 install vosk
```

for more details please visit:

```shell
https://alphacephei.com/vosk/install
```

now we need to install my audio

```shell
pip install pyaudio
```

now our pre-requirements are done, now we have to build the offline speech recognition program. first, we need to import all the necessary

```python
from vosk import Model, KaldiRecognizer
import pyaudio
```

here what we do is import the model and the kaldiRecognizer from the vosk library. along with that, we import py audio.

now we have to download the model for that go to this website and choose your preferred model and download it:

```shell
https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models
```

here I use "  `vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15` " as my model

after download, you can see it is a compressed file unzip it in your root folder, like this

```shell
speech-recognition/
    ├─ vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15 ( Unzip follder ) 
    ├─ offline-speech-recognition.py ( python file )
```

now create a variable called " model " and type this

```shell
model = Model(r"C:\\Users\User\Desktop\python practice\ai\vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15")
```

what we do here we create a variable called " model " and assign our unzip folder location with the Model

```shell
speech-recognition/
    ├─ vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15 ( Unzip follder ) 
```

now we going to create a variable called " recognizer " and assign KaldiRecognizer

```python
recognizer = KaldiRecognizer(model, 16000) 
```

now as usual we have to import the microphone to our code so we import pyaudio

now we going to call the pyaudio to use the microphone to catch the voice.

```python
mic = pyaudio.PyAudio()
stream = mic.open(format=pyaudio.paInt16, channels=1, rate=16000, input=True, frames_per_buffer=8192) stream.start_stream()
```

now we enter the fun part :

```python
while True:
    data = stream.read(4096)
    

    if recognizer.AcceptWaveform(data):
        text = recognizer.Result()
        print(f"' {text[14:-3]} '")
```

what we do here is we write a while loop

create a variable called data and assign it to a " [`stream.read`](https://stream.read)`(4096)` "

```python
    data = stream.read(4096)
```

now we create a decision " if "  recognizer caught a waveform in the data

then assign the results to the variable called " text "  and print it out.

```python
    if recognizer.AcceptWaveform(data):
            text = recognizer.Result()
            print(text)
```

this is the output we got :

```shell
    {
      "text" : "hello"
    }
    {
      "text" : "hello"
    }
    {
      "text" : "hi"
    }
```

to remove { and "text" changes the print command to this :

```python
    print(f"' {text[14:-3]} '")
```

now the output will look like this , clean and more readable:

```python
    '  '
    ' hello '
    ' hi '
    '  '
```

the complete code :

```python
    from vosk import Model, KaldiRecognizer
    import pyaudio
    
    model = Model(r"C:\\Users\User\Desktop\python practice\ai\vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15")
    recognizer = KaldiRecognizer(model, 16000)
    
    mic = pyaudio.PyAudio()
    stream = mic.open(format=pyaudio.paInt16, channels=1, rate=16000, input=True, frames_per_buffer=8192)
    stream.start_stream()
    
    while True:
        data = stream.read(4096)
        
    
        if recognizer.AcceptWaveform(data):
            text = recognizer.Result()
            print(f"' {text[14:-3]} '")
```
